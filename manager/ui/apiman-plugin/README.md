# Hawtio Based API Manager UI

So you're interested in developing the UI for the apiman API Manager?  Here's 
a quick Getting Started guide for that!

1. Install node.js:  http://nodejs.org/
2. Install some stuff using *npm*
    npm install -g bower gulp slush slush-hawtio-javascript slush-hawtio-typescript typescript
3. Change directory into apiman/manager/ui/apiman-plugin
    cd ~/git/apiman/manager/ui/apiman-plugin
4. Use *npm* and *bower* to pull in all dependencies
    npm install
    bower update
5. Run gulp
    gulp
6. Point your browser wherver gulp tells you!  For example:
    [15:09:24] Using gulpfile /home/ewittman/git/apiman/manager/ui/apiman-plugin/gulpfile.js
    [15:09:24] Starting 'bower'...
    [15:09:24] Finished 'bower' after 8.45 ms
    [15:09:24] Starting 'path-adjust'...
    <snip>
    [15:09:28] Finished 'default' after 6.97 Î¼s
    [15:09:28] Server started http://localhost:2772
    [15:09:28] LiveReload started on port 35729

One other thing you must do is create a file in 'js' called 'configuration.nocache.js'.  This
file contains configuration information for the UI application.  You can find a sample version
of this file already in the 'js' directory.  Simply make a copy of it and name the copy
'configuration.nocache.js' and flavor it according to your local configuration.  For example,
this file contains the URL to the apiman back-end REST API.
