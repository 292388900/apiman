/**
 * A connection to a back-end service.  This connection is initiated by apiman when 
 * an inbound service request has passed all of the inbound policies and needs to be
 * proxied to the back-end service.
 * 
 * Consumers of an IServiceConnection are simply responsible for writing all of the
 * inbound request's body data (if any) to the connection.
 * 
 * If the inbound request has data, then the write() method should be called 
 * repeatedly for all of the data in the request.
 * 
 * If an error of some kind occurs while writing the data, then the abort() method 
 * MUST be called.
 * 
 * Once all request payload data has been written (or if no data is available e.g. 
 * for GET requests) then the end() method MUST bve called.
